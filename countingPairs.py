Counting Pairs
Given an integer k and a list of integers, coutn the number of distinct valid pairs
of integers (a, b) in the list for which a + k = b. Two pairs of integers(a, b) and (c, d) are considered distinct
if at least one element of (a, b) does not also belong to (c, d). Note that the elements in a pair might be the same element in the array. An instance of this is below where k=0;
